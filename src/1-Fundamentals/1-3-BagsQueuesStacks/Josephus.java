//1.3.37 Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity,
//N people are in dire straits and agree to the following strategy
//to reduce the population. They arrange themselves in a circle 
//(at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle,
//eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. Legend
//has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being 
//eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that takes N and M from 
//the command line and prints out the order in which people are
//eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
